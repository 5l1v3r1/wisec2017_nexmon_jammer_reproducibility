# What does this repository contain?

On the 10th ACM Conference on Security and Privacy in Wireless and Mobile 
Networks (WiSec 2017) we publish a paper on "Massive Reactive Smartphone-Based 
Jamming using Arbitrary Waveforms and Adaptive Power Control". As WiSec offers
a reproducibility label, we use this repository to make all our measured data
sets as well as the MATLAB scripts to evaluate them and create plots for the
paper available to the public. Sharing these data should not only ease
reproducibility, it should also allow fellow researchers to get started with
our code and build their own research on it.
